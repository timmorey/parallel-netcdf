Parallel Netcdf 1.0.0
=====================


Release Notes:

    - For platform-specific build instructions, see one of the README.<ARCH>
      files.  

    - Fortran routines will pass in a 64 bit integer for some parameters (those
      corresponding to MPI_Offset type in the C routines).  Declare those
      parameters as 'integer(kind=MPI_OFFSET_KIND)'

    - In places where you might use NF_UNLIMITED to define an unlimited
      dimension in one of the nfmpi_ routines, use NFMPI_UNLIMITED.
      NFMPI_UNLIMITED will be defined as the proper type for nfmpi_def_dim,
      whereas nf_unlimited might be too small
      
    - Parallel-NetCDF relies on MPI-IO.  ROMIO, the most common MPI-IO
      implementation, can make use of a prefix in front of the file name to
      specify the underlying file system and override ROMIO's autodetection. A
      typical prefix would look like "nfs:" or "pvfs2:".  Bear this in mind if
      you use a file name with ':' characters.  In some cases, ROMIO might
      think you are passing in a prefix and will complain about an unsupported
      file system type.  If that happens, add a file-system prefix to your file
      name.   
      
      Contact the parallel-netcdf mailing list (parallel-netcdf@mcs.anl.gov) if
      you are confused by the above. 

    - To build parallel-netcdf you will need some additional programs:
        - either yacc or bison
	- either lex or flex
      These are usually part of your operating system's development tools.

    - Users sometimes see the following error: 

      $ mpicc -c -g -O2 -I. -I./../lib -I../lib   mvar.c
      c  strerrorf.f
      make[3]: c: Command not found
      make[3]: [strerrorf.o] Error 127 (ignored)
      c  inq_libversf.f
      make[3]: c: Command not found

      If you get such an error,  setting the MPIF77 environment varialbe before
      running configure will likely solve your problem.
