- the nc_test and nf_test tests use M4 to generate code.  AIX-m4 won't
  generate correct code, so use gnu M4.

- We had a report of a build failure when building the 'ncmpigen' utility.  The
  system 'bison' tool (bison-1.875) did not produce output files, but when the
  user installed a new version of gnu bison, everything worked fine.   

- the pnetcdf code is slowly taking on more and more c99 features.  

On BlueFire, the commands I used look like this:

$ module add m4-1.4.14

$ configure --prefix=/path/to/install \
	CFLAGS=-qlanglvl=stdc99 \
	CC=xlc FC=xlf F77=xlf F90=xlf90 \
	MPICC=mpcc_r MPIF77=mpxlf_r MPIF90=mpxlf90_r CXX=xlC MPICXX=mpCC_r
