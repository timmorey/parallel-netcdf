The pnetcdf library should build fine under IRIX.  There are just a few
issues not directly related to the library:

. The IRIX compiler does not like the cnap.c test.  gcc compiles the
  file without any warnings, even when the tests are configured with
  "--enable-strict".  Renier Vogelsang <reiner@sgi.com> reports that the
  latest MIPSpro compiler release fixes this issue, so upgrade if
  possible.
