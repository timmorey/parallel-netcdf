# Building parallel-netcdf on BGP

Building for BGP is not so different from BGL: front end node is still a cross compile host for the back end.  

Be sure to run configure with the --build and --host flags to put it in "cross
compile mode".  This will make configure use compile-only tests, insted of the
usual compile-and-run tests (running tests on the bgp login node won't work as
the compute nodes are totaly different).

There is one run-time check for MPI-IO support of resized types.  Unfortunately
we have to test for this with a runtime test, but you can set the environemtn
variable "ac_cv_MPI_TYPE_RESIZED_WORKS" . 

configure --host powerpc-bgp-linux  --build powerpc64-suse-linux  \
	--with-mpi=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm

It's possible to build pnetcdf with the IBM xl compilers:

./configure --host powerpc-bgp-linux --build powerpc64-suse-linux \
	CC=mpixlc MPICC=mpixlc FC=mpixlf90 \
	MPIF77=mpixlf90 F77=mpixlf90 F90=mpixlf90 MPIF90=mpixlf90

As far as we know, there are no issues with pnetcdf on BGP, but should you find any, email parallel-netcdf@mcs.anl.gov
