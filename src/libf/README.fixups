The fortran bindings are automatically generated from the c header file.
This is nifty, but not flawless.  Compliation under 'gcc -Wall' will give
some warnings.  

A new script file names "createffiles" has been created to generate all
Fortran files. Usage:

    % setenv MPICH2SRC /home/src/mpich2-1.2.1
    % ./createffiles
