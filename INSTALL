To INSTALL parallel netCDF library:

    1. 'autoreconf' (only necessary if you make changes to configure.in or
        other configure-related files)

    2. ./configure --prefix=<install dir> --with-mpi=/path/to/implementation
	the --with-mpi argument should specify the prefix of where the mpi
	implementation was installed.  If your mpicc is in
	/usr/local/mpich-1.2.3/bin/mpicc then use the prefix
	--with-mpi=/usr/local/mpich-1.2.3

    NOTE: If configure cannot find your MPI implementation's C and/or
	  Fortran compilers, define *both* the MPICC and MPIF77
	  environment variables to be the name of those compilers.  The
	  configure script will then use those values instead of trying
	  to guess.

    3. make 

       We have tried to make the Makefiles platform-independent.
       However, each platform has its own make quirks:  if you run into
       problems, please send a report to the developers at
       parallel-netcdf@mcs.anl.gov.  If you have GNU Make, try using
       that.

    4. make install

IF THIS DOESN'T WORK:

Autoconf should do the right thing: using the system compiler to perform
autoconf tests and then use the MPI compilers to build parallel-netcdf.
If you need to set specific flags for a platform, and autoconf does not
set them for you, then you will have to set some environment variables
to help out the configure script.   Here are some suggested settings:

       For Solaris
            MPICC=mpicc

       For SGI Origin2000
            MPICC = mpicc
            ------------ OR -------------
            CC='/bin/cc -64 -mips4 -lmpi'
            CPPFLAGS=-DNDEBUG
            CFLAGS=-O
            FC='/bin/f90 -64'
            FFLAGS=-O
            F90='/bin/f90 -64'
            CXX='/bin/CC -64'
            CXXFLAGS=-O

       For Linux
            MPICC=mpicc
            CPPFLAGS='-DNDEBUG -Df2cFortran'
            CFLAGS=-O
            CXX=g++
            FFLAGS='-O -W'

       For IBM SP-2
            MPICC mpcc_r
            MPIF77 /bin/mpxlf_r
            F90 /bin/mpxlf90_r
            F90FLAGS -qsuffix=f=f90
            CXX /bin/mpxlC_r
            ------------- OR -------------
            CC xlc
            FC /bin/xlf
            F90 /bin/xlf90
            F90FLAGS -qsuffix=f=f90
            CXX /bin/xlC
                then manually edit macros.make:
            CC = mpcc_r
            FC = mpxlf_r
            F90 = mpxlf90_r
            F90FLAGS = -qsuffix=f=f90
            CXX = mpxlC_r
